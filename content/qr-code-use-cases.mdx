# QR Code Use Cases: Menus, Events, Wi-Fi Sharing

*Updated February 2026.*

QR codes are versatile. Here are some of the most practical use cases.

## Restaurant Menus

Instead of printing disposable menus, restaurants use QR codes on table tents or stickers. Diners scan and view the menu on their phones. Benefits:

- Update prices or items without reprinting
- Reduce contact and waste
- Easy to offer multiple languages

## Events and Conferences

QR codes on badges, lanyards, or tickets can:

- Check people in
- Link to the event app or schedule
- Share speaker bios, slides, or feedback forms
- Connect attendees on social or networking platforms

## Wi-Fi Sharing

Encode your Wi-Fi credentials (SSID + password) in a QR code. Guests scan once and connect—no typing long passwords. Many Wi-Fi routers or management tools can generate these; you can also use a [QR code generator](/) with a special Wi-Fi URL format (e.g., `WIFI:T:WPA;S:YourNetwork;P:YourPassword;;`).

## Product Packaging

Brands put QR codes on packaging to:

- Link to usage instructions or videos
- Offer promotions or loyalty signups
- Provide recycling or sustainability info

## Real Estate

Agents use QR codes on "For Sale" signs. Scan to view listing details, schedule a tour, or contact the agent.

## Business Cards and Flyers

As we covered in other articles, business cards and flyers benefit from QR codes that link to portfolios, landing pages, or contact forms. One scan replaces typing a long URL.
