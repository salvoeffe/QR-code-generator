# QR Codes for Events: Badges, Tickets, and More

Events are a natural fit for QR codes. Here's how to use them effectively.

## Check-In and Tickets

QR codes on tickets or confirmation emails allow fast check-in. Attendees scan at the door; staff verify instantly. Reduces lines and manual lookup. Most event platforms (Eventbrite, Meetup, etc.) provide ticket QR codes automatically.

## Badges and Lanyards

Add a QR code to name badges or lanyards that links to:
- Attendee profile or LinkedIn
- Speaker bio and slides
- Session feedback form
- Event app or schedule

Makes networking and follow-up easier—scan to connect instead of swapping cards.

## Session Materials

Place codes on session handouts, slides, or posters for:
- Download link for slides or resources
- Survey or feedback form
- Related content or further reading

Keeps the room tidy and gives attendees instant access to materials.

## Sponsors and Exhibitors

Sponsor booths can use QR codes for:
- Lead capture (link to form or CRM)
- Product info or demos
- Coupons or special offers
- Social follow or newsletter signup

## Best Practices

- **Size:** Badges need 0.75–1 inch; posters and signage can be larger
- **Test:** Scan codes at the intended distance before the event
- **Backup:** Have a short URL or manual process if scanners fail
- **Privacy:** If the code links to attendee data, ensure proper access controls

For simple, static codes (schedule, feedback form, sponsor link), a [free QR code generator](/) is all you need. [Create one now](/).
