# QR Codes for Real Estate Signs: A Practical Guide

Real estate agents and property managers use QR codes to connect potential buyers with listing details instantly. Here's how to do it right.

## Why QR Codes Work for Real Estate

A "For Sale" or "For Rent" sign has limited space. A QR code lets viewers access full property details, photos, contact forms, and virtual tours with one scan. No typing URLs, no searching. Instant engagement.

## What to Link To

**Listing page:** The ideal destination. Include photos, description, price, and a contact form or agent phone number.

**Contact form:** A simple form that captures name, email, and message. Great for lead generation.

**Virtual tour:** If you have a 3D walkthrough or video, link directly to it.

**Agent profile:** For general yard signs or open house materials, linking to your profile or website works too.

Avoid linking to generic homepage URLs when a specific listing page would be more helpful.

## Size and Placement on Signs

**Size:** Real estate signs are viewed from the street or sidewalk. Make the QR code large enough to scan from a few feet away—at least 2–3 inches (5–7.5 cm) per side. Use the 512px option in our [QR code generator](/) for high-quality output.

**Placement:** Put the code where it's easy to see and reach. Avoid corners that get bent or areas that might be obscured by landscaping. Laminate or use weather-resistant printing so the code stays readable in rain and sun.

## Design Tips

- **Keep it simple:** Black on white scans best. Fancy colors or logos can reduce reliability.
- **Add a call to action:** Text like "Scan for details" or "View listing" tells people what to expect.
- **Test before printing:** Scan the code with your phone from the intended viewing distance. If it doesn't work, make it bigger.

## Static vs Dynamic for Real Estate

**Static QR codes** (from our free tool) are perfect for individual listings. Each sign gets its own code pointing to that property's page. When the property sells, the sign comes down—no need to "edit" the code.

**Dynamic QR codes** are useful if you reuse the same sign for multiple properties (e.g., a generic "Listed by [Agent]" sign) and want to change the destination without reprinting. They typically require a paid service.

For most agents, static codes per listing are the simplest and most cost-effective approach. [Generate one now](/).

## Compliance and Best Practices

Check your local real estate board or MLS for any rules about signage and QR codes. Include required disclosures on the landing page, not just on the sign. Ensure your listing page is mobile-friendly—most scans happen on phones.

## Quick Start

1. Create your listing page (or use your existing MLS/website link).
2. Copy the URL.
3. [Generate a QR code](/).
4. Download the PNG and add it to your sign design.
5. Print, laminate, and install.
6. Test the code from the street before leaving.
