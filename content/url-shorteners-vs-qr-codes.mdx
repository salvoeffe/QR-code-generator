# URL Shorteners vs QR Codes: When to Use Which

URL shorteners and QR codes both help people reach a destination, but they solve different problems. Here's when to use each.

## What URL Shorteners Do

URL shorteners take a long URL and make it shorter. Examples: `bit.ly/abc123`, `t.co/xyz`. They're useful when:

- **Typing or sharing** — Short links fit in tweets, SMS, or printed text
- **Tracking** — Many shorteners offer click analytics
- **Changing destination** — You can update where the short link goes without changing the link itself

## What QR Codes Do

QR codes encode a URL (or other data) as an image. People scan them with a phone camera. They're useful when:

- **No typing** — Ideal for print, signage, packaging, events
- **Speed** — One scan vs. typing or pasting a long URL
- **Physical-world bridging** — Connect offline media to online content

## Key Differences

| Use Case                | URL Shortener | QR Code |
|-------------------------|---------------|---------|
| Share in a tweet        | Yes           | No      |
| Printed flyer           | No (hard to type) | Yes  |
| Email signature         | Yes           | Yes (as image) |
| Business card           | No            | Yes     |
| SMS or chat             | Yes           | Yes (as image) |
| Billboards, posters     | No            | Yes     |

## When to Use Both

You can combine them. Use a short URL inside your QR code so that:

1. The QR code stays simpler (shorter URLs = less dense QR modules)
2. You can change the destination later without reprinting
3. You get analytics if your shortener supports it
