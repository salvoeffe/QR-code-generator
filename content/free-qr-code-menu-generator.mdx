# Free QR Code Menu Generator: No Sign-Up (2026)

A free QR code menu generator lets you create a scannable code for your restaurant menu in seconds—no account, no subscription, no expiration. You paste the URL of your menu (PDF or webpage), download the QR code image, and print it on table tents or cards. Guests scan with their phone camera and the menu opens in the browser. Here’s how to do it in three steps.

## How to Create a Free QR Code for Your Menu

**Step 1: Host your menu.** Put your menu online so it has a stable, public link. Upload a PDF to your website, Google Drive, or Dropbox, or use a dedicated menu page on your site. The link must work on a phone and not require login—test it in your browser’s mobile view before the next step.

**Step 2: Paste the URL and generate.** Open our [free QR code generator](/). Paste your menu URL into the input field. The QR code appears instantly. Choose a size: 512px is a good default for table tents; 384px works for smaller cards. Click **Download PNG** (or SVG for print) and save the image. No sign-up required.

**Step 3: Print and place.** Print the QR code on table tents, standing cards, or stickers. Add a short line like “Scan for menu” so guests know what to do. Laminate table tents to protect against spills; use matte laminate to reduce glare. Place the code where guests naturally look—center of the table or near the condiments.

## Why Use a Free Menu QR Generator?

- **No account.** Create and download without signing up or handing over an email.
- **No expiration.** Static QR codes don’t expire. As long as your menu URL stays valid, the code works.
- **Update anytime.** Change your PDF or webpage whenever you want—prices, items, specials. The URL stays the same, so the QR code stays the same and you don’t reprint.
- **Works everywhere.** Every smartphone camera can read QR codes. Guests don’t need to install an app.
