# QR Codes for Restaurants: Menus and Contactless Ordering

Restaurants have embraced QR codes for menus, ordering, and payments. Here's how to use them effectively.

## Contactless Menus

Replace paper menus with QR codes that link to your digital menu. Guests scan, view on their phone, and you avoid printing and sanitizing physical menus. Update prices or items anytime without reprinting.

**How to set it up:**
1. Host your menu on a web page (your website, a PDF, or a menu platform)
2. [Generate a QR code](/)
3. Print on table tents, stickers, or cards
4. Add a short line like "Scan for menu"

## Size and Placement

- **Table tents:** 2–3 inches per side so guests can scan from across the table
- **Window or door:** Larger—3+ inches—for visibility from outside
- **Counters:** Place where customers naturally look when ordering

## Ordering and Payments

Some restaurants use QR codes to let customers order or pay from their table. This usually requires an ordering or payment platform that provides its own QR codes. For a simple menu link, our free generator is enough.

## Best Practices

- **Mobile-friendly menu:** The linked page must work well on phones—readable font size, fast load
- **Clean codes:** Black on white scans best; avoid covering with logos or text
- **Test regularly:** Scan your codes periodically to ensure the link still works
- **Backup option:** Keep a few paper menus for guests who prefer them or have technical issues
