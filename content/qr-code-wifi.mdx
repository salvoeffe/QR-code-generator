## The Wi-Fi QR Format

Wi-Fi QR codes use a special format that phones recognize: when you scan, the device offers to join the network automatically. The format looks like:

```
WIFI:T:WPA;S:YourNetworkName;P:YourPassword;;
```

- `T:WPA` — encryption type (WPA, WEP, or leave empty for open networks)
- `S:NetworkName` — your Wi-Fi SSID
- `P:Password` — the Wi-Fi password

## How to Create One

1. Open our [free QR code generator](/)
2. Enter the Wi-Fi string. Example for a network named "MyHome" with password "SecretPass123":
   ```
   WIFI:T:WPA;S:MyHome;P:SecretPass123;;
   ```
3. Generate and download the QR code
4. Print it or display it on a screen where guests can scan

## Encryption Types

- **WPA/WPA2:** `WIFI:T:WPA;S:SSID;P:password;;`
- **WEP:** `WIFI:T:WEP;S:SSID;P:password;;`
- **Open (no password):** `WIFI:T:nopass;S:SSID;P:;;`

Most home and business networks use WPA or WPA2.

## Tips for Use

- **Place it visibly:** On a table tent, wall sign, or welcome sheet
- **Size:** At least 1.5 inches per side so phones can scan easily
- **Security:** Anyone with access to the printed code can connect. Use a guest network if possible
- **Test first:** Scan with your own phone to confirm it works before placing in a public area
