# How to Create a QR Code for Your Website (Free)

Creating a QR code for your website is easier than ever. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process step by step—and yes, it's completely free.

## Why Use a QR Code for Your Website?

QR codes let people visit your website instantly by scanning with their phone camera. They're perfect for:

- **Print materials** — Business cards, flyers, brochures
- **Events** — Conference badges, posters, table tents
- **Physical stores** — Window displays, product packaging

No typing required. One scan and they're on your site.

## Step 1: Get Your Website URL

Make sure you have the full URL you want to encode. Examples:

- `https://yoursite.com`
- `https://yoursite.com/landing`
- `https://yoursite.com/special-offer`

Use the exact URL you want visitors to land on.

## Step 2: Use a Free QR Code Generator

You don't need to pay for a QR code. Free tools like ours let you create as many as you need. Here's what to do:

1. Open a free QR code generator (like [this one](/))
2. Paste your website URL into the input field
3. Wait a moment for the QR code to generate
4. Download the image as a PNG file

That's it. The whole process takes under a minute.

## Step 3: Download and Save

Download your QR code in a high enough resolution for your use case. For business cards, 256px is usually fine. For posters or large prints, use 512px or higher. Save it somewhere you can find it easily.

## Step 4: Add It Where You Need It

Use your QR code in:

- **Design tools** — Canva, Figma, Adobe Illustrator
- **Documents** — PDFs, Word, Google Docs
- **Print** — Send to a printer or use at-home printing
- **Digital** — Email signatures, presentations, websites

## Tips for Best Results

- **Test before printing** — Scan your QR code with your phone to confirm it works
- **Keep it simple** — Don't shrink it too small; 1 inch (2.5 cm) minimum is a good rule
- **Add context** — Add text like "Scan for more info" so people know what to do
