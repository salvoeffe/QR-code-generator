# QR Code Best Practices: Size, Placement, and Design

A poorly designed or placed QR code can hurt your conversion rate. Follow these best practices to get the most out of your QR codes.

## Size Matters

QR codes need to be big enough to scan easily, but not so large they dominate your design.

**Minimum size**

- Print: At least 1 inch (2.5 cm) per side for standard scanning distance
- Digital: At least 200×200 pixels on screen
- Far away (e.g., billboards): 2–3 inches or more per side

**Rule of thumb:** The more distance between the viewer and the code, the larger it should be.

## Placement

Where you put your QR code affects how often it gets scanned.

**Do**

- Put it where people naturally look (above the fold, near the main message)
- Ensure good contrast with the background
- Make it easy to reach on mobile (not at the very bottom of a long page)

**Don't**

- Hide it in a corner or tiny footer
- Place it on curved or reflective surfaces that make scanning hard
- Put multiple QR codes too close together (confusion)

## Design and Contrast

QR codes need contrast to be readable. Black on white or dark on light works best.

- **High contrast** — Dark modules on a light background
- **Margin** — Keep a "quiet zone" (white margin) around the code; don't crop it
- **Custom colors** — You can use brand colors, but ensure the scanner can still read it (test!)

## Error Correction

QR codes can tolerate some damage or partial covering. Higher error correction lets you add logos or styling, but increases module density. For most use cases, "Medium" (M) error correction is a good balance.

## Test Before You Ship

Always scan your QR code with a real phone before printing or publishing. Check:

- Does it resolve to the correct URL?
- Does it work in different lighting conditions?
- Does it scan quickly without multiple attempts?
