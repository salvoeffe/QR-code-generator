# Where to Put QR Codes on Flyers, Posters, and Print Ads

A QR code on a flyer or poster only works if people see it, understand what they get, and can actually scan it. Put it in the wrong place or make it too small and your print run turns into wallpaper. Here’s how to place and size QR codes on flyers, posters, and print ads so they get scans instead of shrugs.

## Give It a Clear Job

Before you worry about placement, decide what the code is for. One code, one job. “Scan for menu,” “Get the discount,” “Save our contact”—pick one. If you cram several codes onto one piece or one code that “does everything,” people either ignore it or don’t know which to scan. On a flyer, that usually means one primary code tied to your main offer or next step. Use our [free QR code generator](/) to create it; paste the URL, pick a size, and download.

## Put It Where Eyes Go First

People scan what they notice. On a flyer or poster, that’s rarely the bottom corner or a tiny box in the footer. Put the code where you’re already asking for attention: next to the headline, near the main offer, or in the same visual block as your call-to-action. If the piece has a clear “fold” (e.g. a tri-fold), keep the code above the fold or right at the fold so it’s visible without flipping. On a poster, center or upper-third works; avoid burying it at the very bottom where only the committed will look.

## Size It for Viewing Distance

A code that looks fine on your screen can be useless at arm’s length or across a room. Rule of thumb: the farther away the viewer, the bigger the code.

- **Hand-held flyers and leave-behinds:** At least 1 inch (2.5 cm) per side. Often 1.5–2 inches is safer so it scans quickly.
- **Table tents and counter cards:** 2–3 inches per side so people can scan from across the table or while standing.
- **Posters and window clings:** 2–4 inches or more, depending on how far people will be when they look.
- **Billboards and large outdoor:** Think 3+ feet per side so it’s readable from a car or sidewalk. Export at high resolution (e.g. 1024px or more) so it doesn’t pixelate when blown up.

If you’re not sure, print one copy and try scanning from the distance a real viewer would use.

## Add a Short Call-to-Action

A QR code with no explanation gets skipped. One short line does the work: “Scan for 20% off,” “Menu here,” “Save our contact,” “Get the app.” Put that text directly above or beside the code so the action is obvious. Avoid generic “Scan here” unless the context already makes the benefit clear. The goal is to answer “Why would I scan?” in a few words.

## Keep Contrast and Quiet Zone

Scanners need clear dark/light contrast and an uninterrupted border. Use dark modules on a light background (or the reverse); avoid light gray on white or busy patterns behind the code. Leave a margin (quiet zone) around the code—don’t crowd it with text or graphics. If the code doesn’t scan reliably, see [Why Is My QR Code Not Scanning?](/blog/why-qr-code-not-scanning) for a checklist.

## One Code per Message When You Can

Multiple QR codes on one piece can work if each has a clearly different purpose (e.g. one for menu, one for Wi‑Fi). But if the layout is tight or the audience is in a hurry, one code is usually better. It simplifies the design and reduces “which one do I scan?” confusion. If you do use more than one, separate them visually and label each with its own short CTA.

## Match the Destination to the Moment

The code should take people to a page that matches the promise on the print. “Scan for discount” should land on a page with the offer, not your homepage. “Menu here” should open the menu. If the link goes to the wrong place or a generic landing page, you’ll get more bounces than conversions. Test the URL on a phone before you print; make sure it loads quickly and looks good on a small screen.

## Quick Recap

- **One job per code** — One clear offer or action per piece when possible.
- **Place it where people look** — Near the headline or main CTA, above the fold on flyers.
- **Size for distance** — 1–2 inches for hand-held, 2–4+ for posters and signage; test with a real print.
- **Label it** — A short line like “Scan for 20% off” or “Menu here” tells people why to scan.
- **Contrast and margin** — Dark on light, with a clear border; no graphics overlapping the code.
- **Destination matches the promise** — The link should deliver what the flyer says.

QR codes on flyers and posters work when they’re visible, scannable, and obviously useful. Place them where eyes already go, size them for how far away people will be, and tell people what they get.

## FAQ

**Where should the QR code go on a flyer?**  
Put it where people look first: next to the headline or main offer, above the fold. Avoid the bottom corner or a tiny footer. Add a short line like “Scan for discount” or “Get the menu” so the benefit is clear.

**How big should a QR code be on a poster?**  
At least 2–4 inches per side for something people view from a few feet away. For billboards or large outdoor, think 3+ feet per side and export at high resolution (e.g. 1024px or more) so it stays sharp when enlarged.

**Can I put more than one QR code on a flyer?**  
Yes, if each has a distinct purpose (e.g. one for menu, one for Wi‑Fi) and each is clearly labeled. For simple offers, one code is usually better—less clutter and no confusion about which to scan.

**Why isn’t my flyer QR code scanning?**  
Common causes: code too small for the viewing distance, low contrast (e.g. gray on white), or no quiet zone (margin) around the code. Size it for arm’s length or farther, use dark on light, and test a printed sample before the full run. See [Why Is My QR Code Not Scanning?](/blog/why-qr-code-not-scanning) for a full checklist.
