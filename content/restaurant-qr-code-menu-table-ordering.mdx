# Restaurant QR Code: Menu, Table, and Ordering

A restaurant QR code is a scannable image that opens your menu, ordering link, or contact details on a guest’s phone—no app required. You create one by pasting your menu URL into a free QR generator, downloading the image, and printing it on table tents or cards.

A restaurant QR code puts your menu, table ordering, or contact details one scan away. Whether you run a café, bistro, or bar, a QR code menu lets guests open your offerings on their phone—no app, no paper handoff. This guide walks you through the practical choices (menu only vs table ordering vs contact), how to create and print a QR code for your restaurant, and how to avoid the most common mistakes.

## Menu Only vs Table Ordering vs Contact

Before you generate a code, decide what it should do. The same restaurant QR code can’t do everything unless a single platform powers it.

| Use case | What it does | What you need |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| **Menu only** | Guests view your menu on their phone | A hosted PDF or webpage + our [free QR code generator](/) |
| **Table ordering or payment** | Guests order or pay from the table | An ordering/payment platform (e.g. Toast, Square) that provides its own QR; optionally our generator for a separate “view menu” code |
| **Contact** | “Text us” or “Call us” from a table card or flyer | An [SMS](/sms-qr-generator) or [WhatsApp](/whatsapp-qr-generator) QR code |

**Menu only.** You want guests to view your menu on their phone. You host the menu as a PDF or a webpage, and the QR code points to that link. Our [free QR code generator](/) is enough: paste the URL, download the code, and print. When you update the PDF or page, the link stays the same, so the QR code stays the same—no reprint. This is the simplest and most common use: one static code, one digital menu.

**Table ordering or payment.** If you want guests to order or pay from the table, you typically need an ordering or payment platform (e.g. Toast, Square, or a local provider). Those platforms give you their own QR codes or deep links. You can still use our generator for a separate “view menu” code and let the platform’s code handle “order here.” Many restaurants use both: one code for the menu (ours), one for ordering (the platform’s).

**Contact.** For “text us” or “call us,” use a dedicated contact code. An [SMS QR code](/sms-qr-generator) opens the default messaging app with your number and an optional message pre-filled. A [WhatsApp QR code](/whatsapp-qr-generator) does the same for WhatsApp. Handy on table cards or flyers when you want direct contact instead of a menu link.

## How to Make a QR Code for Your Restaurant Menu

**1. Host your menu.** Put your menu somewhere that has a stable, public URL. Options: a PDF on your website, Google Drive, Dropbox, or a menu platform; or a dedicated menu page on your site. A PDF is the fastest: design once, upload, and share the link. A webpage can load faster and adapt to screen size but needs more setup. For most restaurants, a well-designed PDF hosted on your site or cloud storage is the simplest and most reliable.

**2. Get the URL and test it.** Copy the link that opens your menu. Make sure the link is public (no login required) and that it works on a phone. Open it in your browser’s mobile view or on your smartphone before you generate the QR code. A typo or a broken redirect will frustrate every guest who scans.

**3. Generate the QR code.** Use our [free QR code generator](/): paste the URL, choose a size, and download. For table tents, 512px is a good default; for smaller cards, 384px can work. Use PNG for most print; use SVG if your printer or designer prefers vector. No sign-up required. The code works as long as the link stays valid—static QR codes don’t expire.

**4. Print and place.** Print the QR code on table tents, standing cards, or stickers. Add a short line like “Scan for menu” so guests know what to do. Laminate table tents to protect against spills and wear; matte laminate reduces glare and improves scanning. Place the code where guests naturally look: center of the table, near condiments, or at the counter. For more on placement and lighting, see [The 2026 Restaurant Guide to QR Code Menus](/blog/restaurant-qr-code-menu-guide-2026).

## Size and Placement: Practical Specs

**Table tents.** Aim for at least 2–3 inches per side so guests can scan from across the table. Export at 512px from our [generator](/); for high-quality print, use 300 DPI or equivalent so the code stays sharp. Test with your phone from a seated position before you print in bulk.

**Door or window.** For codes visible from the sidewalk or street, use a larger size—3 inches or more per side. Scan distance is greater, so the code must be bigger to read reliably.

**Contrast and quiet zone.** Use dark modules on a light background (or the reverse) for strong contrast. Keep a clear margin around the code; don’t cover it with logos or text. If guests struggle to scan, see [Why Is My QR Code Not Scanning?](/blog/why-qr-code-not-scanning) for a full checklist.

## Common Mistakes

**Too small or low contrast.** A code that looks fine on screen can fail when printed small or in low light. Size up for table tents and bars; stick to black on white (or high-contrast brand colors) so cameras can read the pattern.

**Wrong or broken URL.** Always test the link before and after generating. Check for typos, redirects that break on mobile, or pages that require login. If the code scans but the page doesn’t load, the problem is the destination, not the code.

**Skipping a real-world test.** Scan the code from the actual table or counter where it will live. Lighting and angle matter; a code that works in the office may fail in a dim corner. Fix size or placement before you roll out to every table.

## FAQ

**Do guests need an app to scan the menu?**  
No. Every smartphone camera reads QR codes natively. Guests point, scan, and the menu opens in the browser. No app download required.

**How do I update my menu without reprinting the QR code?**  
If your QR code points to a hosted PDF or webpage, you update the file or page—not the code. The URL stays the same, so the QR code stays the same. Re-upload the PDF or edit the page, and every table gets the new menu.

**Is a PDF menu better than a webpage?**  
It depends. A PDF is easier: design once, upload, done. A webpage can load faster and adapt to screen size, but requires more setup. For most restaurants, a well-designed PDF hosted on your site or cloud storage is the simplest and most reliable option.

**What size should the QR code be for a table tent?**  
Aim for at least 2–3 inches per side (about 512px at print resolution). In dim lighting or at a distance, go larger—3 inches or more—to improve scan success.

**Can one QR code do both menu and ordering?**  
Only if the same platform serves both (e.g. a menu page that also has an “order” button). Otherwise use one code for the menu (e.g. from our [generator](/)) and a separate code from your ordering platform for “order here.”

## Bring It Together

A restaurant QR code for your menu and table reduces friction: guests get the menu on their phone, you update it anytime without reprinting, and you can pair it with ordering or contact codes as needed. Use our [free QR code generator](/) to create a menu code in seconds—no sign-up, no expiration. For a short, tool-focused walkthrough, see [Free QR Code Menu Generator: No Sign-Up (2026)](/blog/free-qr-code-menu-generator).
