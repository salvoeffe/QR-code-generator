# Restaurant QR Code: Menu, Table, and Ordering

A restaurant QR code lets you put your menu, table ordering, or contact info one scan away. Here’s how to use a QR code for your menu and tables—and how to get one for free.

## Why use a QR code menu?

- **Update anytime** — Change prices or items on the linked page; the same QR code keeps working.
- **Less contact** — Guests use their own phone; no shared paper menus.
- **Table-ready** — Print once on table tents or cards; every table can scan.

## How to create a restaurant QR code for your menu

1. **Host your menu** — Put your menu on a webpage or a PDF (your site, Google Drive, or a menu platform).
2. **Get the URL** — Copy the link that opens that menu.
3. **Generate the QR code** — Use our [free QR code generator](/): paste the URL, pick a size (512px is good for table tents), and download PNG or SVG.
4. **Print and place** — Print on table tents, stickers, or cards. Add a short line like “Scan for menu.”

No sign-up required; the code works forever as long as the link stays valid.

## Table and placement tips

- **Table tents:** 2–3 inches per side so guests can scan from across the table.
- **By the door or window:** Use a larger code (3+ inches) so it’s visible from outside.
- **Contrast:** Black on white scans best; avoid covering the code with logos or text.

Use the **512px** size from our [generator](/) for print.

## Menu vs ordering vs contact

- **Menu only** — One QR code that opens your menu (PDF or webpage). Our [free generator](/) is enough.
- **Ordering or payment** — Usually handled by an ordering/payment platform that gives you its own QR codes. You can still use our generator for a simple “view menu” code and use the platform’s code for “order here.”
- **Contact** — For “call us” or “text us,” use an [SMS QR code](/sms-qr-generator) or [WhatsApp QR code](/whatsapp-qr-generator).
