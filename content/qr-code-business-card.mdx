## Decide What Your QR Code Should Link To

Common options:

- **Personal website or portfolio** — Show your work
- **LinkedIn profile** — Professional networking
- **vCard or contact page** — One-tap save to contacts ([create a vCard QR code](/vcard-qr-generator))
- **Calendar booking link** — Schedule a meeting

Pick one primary destination. You can always create multiple cards for different purposes.

## Generate Your QR Code

1. Copy the URL you want to encode
2. Open a [free QR code generator](/)
3. Paste the URL and download the PNG
4. Use 256px or 384px—enough for print clarity without huge file size

## Add It to Your Design

**In design software (Canva, Figma, etc.)**

- Import the PNG as an image
- Resize to about 0.75–1 inch (2–2.5 cm) per side
- Place it in a corner or below your name—somewhere clear but not dominating

**With a printer**

- Ensure 300 DPI or higher for crisp output
- Leave a small margin (quiet zone) around the QR code
- Use high contrast: dark code on light background

## Design Tips

- **Don't cover it** — Avoid placing text or graphics over the QR code
- **Test before printing** — Order a small batch first, or print a test sheet
- **Add a cue** — A short line like "Scan for my portfolio" helps people know what to do
