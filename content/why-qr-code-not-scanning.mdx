# Why Is My QR Code Not Scanning?

A QR code that won't scan is frustrating. Here are the most common causes and how to fix them.

## 1. The Code Is Too Small

QR codes need a minimum size to be readable by phone cameras. Too small, and the scanner can't distinguish the individual modules.

**Fix:** For print, aim for at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) per side. For digital use (websites, screens), 200×200 pixels minimum. Use our [QR code generator](/) with the 384px or 512px size option for print projects.

## 2. Poor Contrast

QR codes rely on high contrast between the dark modules and the light background. Low contrast or inverted colors can cause failures.

**Fix:** Use black (or very dark) modules on a white (or very light) background. Avoid light gray on white, or dark gray on black. If you use custom colors, test before printing in bulk.

## 3. Damaged or Covered Areas

Scratches, folds, or anything covering part of the code can prevent scanning. The "quiet zone"—the white margin around the code—is also critical. Cropping too close or placing text over it can break scanning.

**Fix:** Keep a clear margin around the QR code. Don't add logos, text, or graphics over the pattern. Print on smooth, flat surfaces when possible.

## 4. The Wrong URL or Broken Link

If the code scans but the destination fails to load, the problem isn't the code—it's the link.

**Fix:** Double-check the URL before generating. Test it in a browser. Ensure the website is live and doesn't require login. Avoid very long URLs if possible; they create denser codes that are harder to scan when small.

## 5. Lighting and Angle

Glare, shadows, or an extreme angle can prevent the camera from reading the code clearly.

**Fix:** Ensure good, even lighting. Avoid glossy surfaces that create reflections. Hold the camera straight-on rather than at a sharp angle.

## 6. Out-of-Focus or Blurry Print

If the print quality is low or the image was upscaled, the code can become blurry and unreadable.

**Fix:** Export the QR code at sufficient resolution (our tool offers up to 512px). Use 300 DPI or higher for print. Don't stretch or resize a small image to a large format.

## 7. Phone or App Issues

Sometimes the problem is on the scanning side. Older phones or buggy scanner apps can fail even with a perfect code.

**Fix:** Try a different phone or the built-in camera app (iOS and Android both scan QR codes natively). Ensure the camera lens is clean. Test with a known-good code (e.g., from our homepage) to confirm your device works.

## Quick Checklist

Before printing or publishing, verify:

- [ ] Size is at least 1 inch for print, 200px for digital
- [ ] High contrast (dark on light)
- [ ] No damage, folds, or overlapping graphics
- [ ] White margin (quiet zone) around the code
- [ ] URL is correct and loads in a browser
- [ ] Image is sharp and not upscaled

[Create a new QR code](/) with these tips in mind, and you should have a reliable, scannable result.
