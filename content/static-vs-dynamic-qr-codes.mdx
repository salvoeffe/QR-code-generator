# Static vs Dynamic QR Codes: Which One Do You Need?

Understanding the difference between static and dynamic QR codes helps you choose the right tool for your use case.

## What Is a Static QR Code?

A **static QR code** encodes the data directly into the image. The URL, text, or other content is embedded in the pattern itself. Once generated, the code is fixed—you cannot change what it points to without creating a new code.

**Pros:**
- Free to create (use our [free generator](/))
- No expiration
- Works without internet (for URLs, the destination site must be online)
- No vendor or subscription required
- Simple and reliable

**Cons:**
- Cannot edit the destination without reprinting
- No built-in analytics

## What Is a Dynamic QR Code?

A **dynamic QR code** encodes a short redirect URL that points to a server. When someone scans, they're sent to the server, which then redirects them to the final destination. The server can change where that redirect goes at any time, and can log scans.

**Pros:**
- Editable destination without reprinting
- Scan analytics (views, locations, devices)
- Can point to different content for different users (personalization)

**Cons:**
- Usually requires a paid service
- Depends on the provider's server (if they shut down, the code breaks)
- More complex setup

## When to Use Static QR Codes

Static codes are ideal when:

- **Permanence matters:** Business cards, product packaging, permanent signage
- **Simplicity matters:** Menus, flyers, Wi-Fi sharing, event tickets
- **Cost matters:** You want a free, no-strings-attached solution
- **The content won't change:** The URL or text is final

Most small businesses, freelancers, and individuals are best served by static QR codes. [Generate one for free](/).

## When to Use Dynamic QR Codes

Dynamic codes make sense when:

- **You need analytics:** Marketing campaigns, ad tracking, engagement metrics
- **The destination may change:** Promotions, landing pages, A/B tests
- **You have budget:** Subscription fees for dynamic QR services
- **You need flexibility:** Different content for different audiences
